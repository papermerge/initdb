# InitDB

Small package that creates a user and database owned by that user.
Note that it works only with *postgres* database.
Optionally it can:

* wait for database connection to be ready

## Setup

    $ pip install initdb

## Usage

    import initdb as init

    if init.db_is_ready(): # blocks script execution until database is ready
        init.create_user()
        init.create_db()

InitDB reads its configuration from following sources:

* command line arguments
* configuration file
* environment variables

If no command line arguments are supplied, initdb will search for its settings
in configuration file. If neither command line arguments nor configuration file was provided
it will try to read settings from environment variables.

Highest priority have command line arguments, this basically means that if
same value is provided as command line argument and configuration file
(and maybe environment variable) - only the value given as command line
argument will be taken into account.

Configuration file settings have priority over environment variables.

## Environment Variables

* INITIAL_DATABASE_USER - default value is `postgres`
* INITIAL_DATABASE_PASSWORD - default value is an empty string
* DATABASE_HOST - default value is `postgres`
* DATABASE_NAME - database to be created
* DATABASE_PASSWORD - set this password for the newly created user
* DATABASE_PORT - default value is 5432
* DATABASE_USER - database user to be created
